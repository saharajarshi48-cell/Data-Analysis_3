I have just completed my AIRBNB project analysis by using python. Here is the questions that is solved in this project 
What is the distribution of listing prices? 
How are different room types distributed? 
How are listings distributed across different neighborhoods? 
What is the relationship between price and room type? 
How has the number of reviews changed over time? 
And here are the solutios of the questions 
1. Conclusion: Distribution of Listing Prices
Most Airbnb listings fall in the low to mid-price range, with the majority priced between ₹80–₹200 (approx.).
The price distribution is right-skewed, meaning a few luxury listings with extremely high prices raise the average price.
Therefore, the median price is a more reliable indicator than the mean.

2. Conclusion: Distribution of Room Types
The platform is dominated by “Entire home/apartment” and “Private room” listings.
Shared rooms and hotel rooms form a very small portion of the total listings.
This shows that users prefer privacy, and hosts mostly supply full homes or private spaces.

3. Conclusion: Distribution Across Neighborhoods
Listings are highly concentrated in Manhattan and Brooklyn, while Queens has moderate presence. Bronx and Staten Island are underrepresented. 
This indicates that tourism demand and hosting activity are strongest in central urban areas.

4. Conclusion: Relationship Between Price and Room Type
There is a direct relationship between room type and price:
Entire homes are the most expensive
Private rooms are moderately priced
Shared rooms are the cheapest
This confirms that privacy, space, and exclusivity strongly influence pricing.

5. Conclusion: Change in Number of Reviews Over Time
The number of reviews increases over time, indicating growing platform usage and customer engagement.
The trend also shows seasonal fluctuations, meaning Airbnb experiences peak demand during certain months of the year

This project demonstrates a complete exploratory analysis pipeline on Airbnb listing data:
Cleaning and understanding a real-world dataset.
Visualizing key and distributions and relationships.
Extracting actionable business insights around pricing, room types, geographic distribution, and review trends.
These insights can be used by Airbnb to refine pricing strategies, target host acquisition in specific neighborhoods, improve guest search experience, and support data-driven growth decisions.
